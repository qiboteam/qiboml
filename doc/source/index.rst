      Qiboml


What is Qiboml?
===============


Qiboml is an open-source and full-stack quantum machine learning package based on Qibo.
Among the goals of Qiboml we have:

* provide automatically differentiable backends for any Qibo application;
* render Qibo circuits as differentiable layers of well-known machine learning frameworks such as `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ and `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_;
* extend quantum machine learning algorithm execution to self-hosted devices through `Qibolab <https://github.com/qiboteam/qibolab>`_;
* integrate hardware-level routines into higher-level quantum machine learning algorithms through `Qibocal <https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal>`_.
